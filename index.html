							<p><strong>Physics Informed Neural Networks for Heat Equation</strong> This project implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the heat equation, a fundamental partial differential equation in physics and engineering. PINNs represent a novel scientific machine learning approach that embeds physical laws directly into neural network training through custom loss functions. The implementation tackles two key problems: Forward Problem: Given a known diffusion coefficient κ(x)=1.0, the neural network learns to predict the temperature field u(t,x) across space and time. Inverse Problem: Using only 100 sparse measurements (1% of total solution points), the model simultaneously recovers both the temperature field AND the unknown diffusion coefficient. The neural architecture consists of: Temperature network: 4 hidden layers with 20 neurons per layer and tanh activation. Diffusion coefficient network: 2 hidden layers with 10 neurons per layer and softplus activation. Training uses ADAM optimizer with learning rate scheduling. A comprehensive comparison with traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) reveals that while FEM achieves slightly better accuracy for the forward problem (0.0031 vs 0.0066 mean error), PINNs excel in solving the inverse problem by directly recovering the unknown diffusion coefficient from limited data. Key advantages of PINNs demonstrated in this project include: Physics-informed constraints that ensure solutions satisfy governing equations. Ability to handle inverse problems without iterative optimization loops. Continuous, differentiable solutions across the entire domain. Efficient utilization of sparse measurements. The results confirm PINNs as a powerful tool for scientific computing, especially for scenarios with limited data availability or unknown physical parameters. </p>

							<p><strong>Portfolio Optimization Using Penalized Regression: Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net</strong> Project Overview: I developed a machine learning approach to stock portfolio optimization using penalized regression techniques (Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net) on S&P 500 data to address multicollinearity, overfitting, and improve feature selection in quantitative finance. Key Achievements - Achieved significant outperformance with Ridge (27.61% return, +49.73% vs benchmark) and Elastic Net (26.14% return, +41.77% vs benchmark) portfolios - Demonstrated effective feature selection with Ridge (85 features) and Elastic Net (11 features) - Identified optimal sector allocations and key stock selections driving performance. Technical Approach - Processed S&P 500 financial data including company metrics, prices, and sector classifications - Implemented 80/20 train-test splitting for reliable out-of-sample validation - Used cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning and coefficient analysis - Created sector allocation visualizations for portfolio interpretation. Investment Insights - Top sectors: Industrials (40%), Technology (30%), Healthcare (20%) - Consistent performers: ON Semiconductor, Axon, Salesforce, Vertex Pharmaceuticals - Elastic Net provided best balance between returns and diversification. The results demonstrate how machine learning can enhance portfolio management by reducing overfitting, managing feature correlation, and generating significant alpha compared to benchmarks.  </p>

							<p><strong>Advanced Statistical and Machine Learning Insights into USDA Rural Housing Data</strong> This dashboard analyzes USDA Rural Development Multi-Family Housing data using various statistical methods to explore relationships between demographics, income, and housing characteristics: Logistic Regression predicts above-average income properties based on household count, showing 40.2% probability for 30-household properties. KNN Analysis for income prediction finds k=50 provides optimal balance, revealing a positive relationship between household size and income. Multiple Regression shows both elderly and disabled populations positively affect household counts, with disabled residents having stronger impact (0.79 vs 0.30 units). Ridge Regression identifies Other_Income_Average and Public_Assistant_Income as strongest predictors of annual income while effectively balancing model complexity. Naive Bayes Classification reveals significant class imbalance (97.5% low cost-burden) with annual income and minor count as key predictors of cost burden status. LOESS Fitting shows mild positive non-linear association between female household heads and annual income, with wider confidence intervals at higher counts. Secondary Logistic Regression finds designated minors count strongly negatively predicts elderly-focused properties, while female household heads show positive association. The dashboard presents findings through visualizations, statistical summaries, and interpretations, providing insights into rural housing patterns and the relationships between property characteristics, demographics, and economic outcomes. </p>

							<p><strong>Quantitative Analysis of Ideological Biases in Search Engine Results </strong> My research team conducted an extensive data analysis investigating bias in Google's search algorithm across politically charged topics. Using sentiment analysis on 109 bipolar search queries and topics, we found clear evidence of non-neutral search results. Key findings: Google displays measurable sentiment bias across controversial topics, with virtually no neutral article distribution. Political sentiment analysis reveals Google's results lean slightly Totalitarian (52.3%), more strongly Collectivist (59.6%), and Progressive (58.7%). Bias varies significantly by topic category: environmental, healthcare, and education topics show Collectivist-Progressive bias, while gun and judicial topics display Libertarian-Conservative bias. Cluster analysis confirmed these patterns aren't random—specific topic groups consistently receive similar sentiment treatment. Methodology included: Web scraping Google search results for controversial topics and political questions. Sentiment analysis using the AFINN-165 dataset to measure positivity/negativity. Political axis mapping across Totalitarian-Libertarian, Collectivist-Individualist, and Progressive-Conservative dimensions. K-means clustering to identify topic relationships. Visualization through divergent bar charts, boxplots, MDS, and 3D political scatter plots. This research raises important questions about algorithmic neutrality in information discovery. While overall bias is slight (+0.01 sentiment per word on each political axis), the consistent deviation from neutrality demonstrates how search engines may inadvertently shape public discourse on contentious issues. Understanding these patterns is crucial for media literacy and developing more balanced information systems that present diverse viewpoints on complex political topics.

							<p><strong>Modeling Consensus Dynamics in Static and Switching Networks</strong> This project explores how groups of interacting agents reach consensus using averaging algorithms applied over network structures. Drawing from real-world examples like bird flocking and distributed systems, the study models consensus behavior on both static and switching (time-varying) networks using tools from linear algebra, graph theory, and numerical simulation. The analysis begins with three static networks (A1, A2, A3), each represented by an adjacency matrix. The corresponding Laplacian matrices are computed, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to assess the network's connectivity. The number of zero eigenvalues indicates how many connected components exist, which directly influences whether a network can reach consensus. Both discrete-time and continuous-time averaging models are studied. It is shown that the state where all agents have the same value is an equilibrium for both models, and conditions are derived to ensure stability in the discrete case. Specifically, the update step size must be within a safe range based on the largest nonzero Laplacian eigenvalue. Simulations confirm that proper choices lead to convergence, while poor choices cause instability or divergence. The project then explores switching networks, where the structure changes randomly at each time step. Simulations using different connection probabilities (such as 0.1 and 0.9) show that more connected networks lead to faster and more reliable consensus. A disagreement metric is used to measure how quickly the agent values align over time. Overall, the project demonstrates how the structure and behavior of networks directly impact the ability of agents to achieve consensus, bridging mathematical theory with computational modeling.</p>

							<p><strong>Google Data Analytics Course Capstone Project: Case Study 1 "Cyclistic"</strong> This project is my approach and work to solve the problem of Google Data Analytics Course Capstone Project: Case Study 1 "Cyclistic". The main objective of our case study is "How to convert casuals to members?". I used PySpark SQL with Jupyter Notebook for the data cleaning since the dataset is too large to merge and operate (around 4,073,561 observations). Once data was cleaned I did the analysis in R. As a result, I observed the following from the given data: -Casual usage is slow for weekdays but weekends are very popular especially Saturday. -Docked bike is the most popular for both members and casuals. But we can see that casuals prefer docked bike more than members do. -The average distance traveled by members and casuals are almost same, however, members average trip duration ~15 min. is almost three times less than casual mean trip duration ~42 min. -Casual users tend to start and end trips from the same station while its little different for members. and some others. Considering the above observations and insights we can suggest the following: 1. We could increase the renting price of the bikes for the weekend to target casual users into having a membership especially for docked bikes, since they are preferred more by causal users. 2. Providing a special service or perks for only members might motivate casual users to have a membership. Services might include free ice cream or lemonade, free tour guide, or fast line for renting without any line etc </p>

							<p><strong>For starters, </strong> I'm 21 years old and originally from Richmond, VA. Two things I’ve always loved are spending time with my family and diving into math. My passion for mathematics really took shape during high school at Glen Allen High School, where I earned my Advanced Studies Diploma. Over time, I found that coding felt like a natural extension of my problem-solving skills—it just made sense. That led me to pursue a degree at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), where I'm currently studying Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA) with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. My coursework blends rigorous mathematical analysis with hands-on, intensive programming.</p>
